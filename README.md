# Fontra Pak for Linux Desktops 
[![fontrapak](https://snapcraft.io/fontrapak/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/fontrapak)

[Fontra](http://fontra.xyz/) is an open-source, browser-based, cross-platform, variable-first font editor.

This repo is for snap packaging of fontra.  


![Hello in Fontra](https://docs.fontra.xyz/images/fontra-index.png)




Fontra extends the boundaries of what current font editors can do. Originally 
  developed to make the design and production of large CJK fonts more efficient,
   Fontra provides deeper integration of variable font technology and improved
  usability of variable components as design elements.


It is developed by Black[Foundry] and Just van Rossum with support from Google.


Fontra is different from most other editors because it works in the browser. Using the Fontra Pak application, you can run Fontra locally to edit files on your computer. Fontra can also be used remotely from a server, allowing collaboration in real-time between multiple users.

The snap packaging is unofficial community effort by Anirban Mitra, a fontra user.
